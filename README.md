## The decentralized web, also called Web 3.0 is here!
We at Wavect.io  have released today our new Blockchain-based voucher system.

* Take a look here: https://token.wavect.io
* More Details also on our main website: https://wavect.io

## But what is this about?
Settle invoices in a cryptocurrency & earn so-called Wavect-Tokens. These tokens can then be redeemed in future projects. Basically it's just a futuristic & decentralized voucher :-).

## Behind the scences
The above web-application relies on so-called smart-contracts (= intelligent & decentralized contracts executed on the Blockchain).

There are still a lot of opportunities in the Blockchain world, don't wait too long and contact us today to discuss interesting use-cases for your organization.
